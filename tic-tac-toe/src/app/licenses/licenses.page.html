<br>
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION<br>
<br>
  1. Definitions.<br>
<br>
  "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,<br>
  and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.<br>
<br>

  the copyright owner that is granting the License.<br>
<br>

  direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or<br>
  otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the<br>
  outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.<br>
<br>
  "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity<br>
  exercising permissions granted by this License.<br>
<br>
  "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,<br>
  including but not limited to software source code, documentation<br>
  source, and configuration files.<br>
<br>
  "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical<br>
  transformation or translation of a Source form, including but<br>
  not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,<br>
  and conversions to other media types.<br>
<br>
  "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or<br>
  Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a<br>
  copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work<br>
  (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br>
<br>
  "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<br>
  form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<br>
  editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<br>
  represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes<br>
  of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br>
  separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br>
  the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
<br>
  "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including<br>
  the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<br>
  to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally<br>
  submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner<br>
  or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of<br>
  the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"<br>
  means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent<br>
  to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to<br>
  communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,<br>
  and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the<br>
  Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but<br>
  excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise<br>
  designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."<br>
<br>
  "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity<br>
  on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and<br>
  subsequently incorporated within the Work.<br>
<br>
  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
  copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br>
  publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br>
  Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br>
<br>
  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
  (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br>
  use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br>
  where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br>
  by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br>
  Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br>
  with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br>
  institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>
  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>
  or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br>
  or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>
  granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>
  as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br>
  Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br>
  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>
  meet the following conditions:<br>
<br>
  (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
  (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
  stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>
  (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br>
  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>
  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>
  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>
  the Derivative Works; and<br>
<br>
  (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br>
  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>
  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>
  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>
  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>
  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>
  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>
  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>
  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>
  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>
  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>
  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>
  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>
  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>
  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>
  as modifying the License.<br>
<br>
  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>
  may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>
  for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>
  for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>
  reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>
  the conditions stated in this License.<br>
<br>
  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>
  any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>
  by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>
  this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>
  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>
  the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>
  with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>
  names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>
  except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>
  origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>
  agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>
  Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br>
  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>
  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>
  of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>
  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>
  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
<br>
  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>
  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>
  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>
  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>
  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>
  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>
  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>
  Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>
  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>
  other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>
  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
<br>
  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>
  the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>
  and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>
  or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>
  License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>
  on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>
  of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>
  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>
  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>
  of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br>
<br>
  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
